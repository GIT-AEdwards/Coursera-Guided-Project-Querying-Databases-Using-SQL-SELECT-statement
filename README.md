# Coursera-Guided-Project-Querying-Databases-Using-SQL-SELECT-statement

# About the project
In this 2-hour long project-based course, you will learn how to retrieve data from tables in a database using SQL SELECT statement. In addition, this project will expose you to how to use different SQL operators together with the WHERE clause to set conditions on tables in a database for database manipulation. In order to reinforce the use of SQL SELECT statement to query a database for database insights, you will work on different tasks as the concepts are being introduced to you.

# Additional Project Overview
Welcome to this project-based course on querying database using SQL SELECT statement. In this project, you will learn how to retrieve data from a database using the SELECT statement. In addition, you will learn how to set conditions on data retrieved from a database. By the end of this 2-hour long project, you will understand how to use the WHERE clause together with other SQL operators to retrieve data from a database. By extension, you will learn how to sort result set in ascending or descending order. Also, you will learn how to set limits on result set of a query. Finally, you will learn how to give a temporary name to a column of a table in a result set. Note, you do not need to be a data administrator or data analyst to be successful in this guided project, just a familiarity with SQL suffice for this project. If you are not familiar with SQL and want to learn the basics, start with my previous guided project titled “Performing Data definition and Manipulation in SQL."

# What I did
- Retrieve data from tables in the employees database
- Retrieve data from the employees database by setting conditions using the WHERE clause
- Use different SQL operators together with the WHERE clause
- Retrieve data from a database using different wildcard characters with the WHERE clause
- Use other comparison operators together with the WHERE clause
- Select distinct data from tables, sort result set, limit the result set, and give a temporary name to a column of a table

# Result / Brief Reflection
- Quick refresher on skills previously learned in DAD-220.
- Earned a certificate for this project.
- Still confident and happy to work with databases.
- Learned a couple new facts / abilities (making queries more simple, clean and effective.)

# Fast Facts - What I Understand
- The wildcard character _ (underscore) matches a single character; % (percentage sign) matches a sequences of characters, and * (asterisk) matches all characters.
- To sort a result set in SQL, the ORDER BY statement is used. In addition, we use ASC to sort in ascending order and DESC to sort in descending order. Also, when the order is not specified, SQL sorts the result set in ascending order by default.
- The LIMIT statement that sets a limit on the result set is returned last.
- SELECT DISTINCT is used to retrieve different and distinct values of a column of a table.
- BETWEEN - AND helps us designate the interval to which a given value belongs.
- The wildcard characters % matches a sequence of characters. Therefore, the % in front of ar and % at the end shows that the characters ar follow in all the names returned.
- The logical operator precedence is an SQL rule stating that in the execution of the query, the operator AND is applied first, while the operator OR is applied second.
- LIKE and NOT LIKE are used in the WHERE clause with wildcard characters to match specific patterns in a column of a table.
- The WHERE clause allows us to set a condition upon which we will specify what part of the data we want to retrieve from the database.
- FROM indicates the table we want to retrieve data from.
- The SELECT statement indicates the columns or fields of a table.
